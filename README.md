# Diwali-Sales-Analysis

This data analysis project on Diwali sales aims to analyze the sales trends of various products during the festive season. The project will involve collecting and cleaning the data from various sources such as sales reports and online platforms, and then using various data analysis techniques to gain insights into the sales patterns.
The project will start with importing and cleaning the data, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data. During EDA, various visualizations such as line plots, bar charts will be used to identify the trends in the data. The project will also involve identifying the most popular products during the Diwali season.
The project will be implemented using Python programming language, and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn will be used for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. The project will be documented on GitHub, including the code, visualizations, and findings. The code will be well-documented, and best practices for reproducible research will be followed. The project will provide a valuable insight into the sales trends during the festive season, which can be used by businesses to optimize their sales strategies.
